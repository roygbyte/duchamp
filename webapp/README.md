# Installation

You need to have NVM (Node Version Manager) installed. See elsewhere for instructions on setting that up. When you're done, run the commands listed below:

```bash
nvm install 6.11.7
nvm use 6.11.7
npm install -g gulp
npm install -g yarn
yarn install
```

To start the server at `localhost:3000`:

```bash
node start
```
